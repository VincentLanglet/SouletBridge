    title: A unique festival in Paris
    text: |
        We are thrilled to welcome you in the magnificent surroundings of the Paris Country Club to our bridge festival from 5<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> November 2015.

        Prior to the International Festival of Paris, a championship of Paris will be held on 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> November in partnership with Funbridge devoted to novice, intermediate and recently advanced players.

        From 7<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> November, Mixed pairs, IMP's and Open tournaments will take place with great prizes in money and in-kind.
        Simultaneously, novice and intermediate players who do not wish to participate in the main tournaments (presumably stronger) will be offered special tournaments with boards analysis sheets.

        Everyday, we will be pleased to invite you to a cocktail party followed by an optional dinner with musical entertainment or a bridge debate with champions.

        Located at around ten minutes from the center of Paris, the Paris Country Club opens the doors of its new hotel and its prestigious reception rooms.

        You will play in an early 20<sup>th</sup> century listed building surrounded by 136 acres of greenery.

        Only a few meters from the playing room, the newly built 4 stars Hotel Renaissance Paris Hippodrome de St. Cloud is proud to welcome in one of its 110 rooms and suites at a preferred price during the festival (see Hotel).

        Hotel guests will have a free access to the fitness center and will be able to play in the Country Club’s private golf course at an attractive price.
