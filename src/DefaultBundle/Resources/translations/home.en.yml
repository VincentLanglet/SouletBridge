        We are thrilled to welcome you in the magnificent surroundings of the Paris Country Club to our bridge festival from 5th to 11th November 2015.

        Prior to the International Festival of Paris, a championship of Paris will be held on 5th and 6th November in partnership with Funbridge devoted to novice, intermediate and recently advanced players. From 7th to 11th November, Mixed Pairs, IMP's and Open tournaments will take place with great prizes in Money and in-kind.

        Simultaneously, players with a ranking of who do not wish to participate in the main tournaments will be offered special tournaments with boards analysis sheets.

        Everyday, we will be pleased to invite you to a cocktail party followed by an optional dinner with musical entertainment or a bridge debate with champions.
