        We are pleased to welcome you Again in the superb setting of the Paris Country Club for a one-week bridge festival from 25 to 31 October 2018.

        As a prelude to the festival on October 24th at 2pm, the Paris Country Club also makes us happy to host this year's Epsilon Cup for the benefit of the telethon: a Pairs Event composed of one player under 30 and one player over 30 which will raise funds for the Téléthon, an association wich initiates innovative actions and a strategy of general interest that benefits all rare diseases and all persons with disabilities.

        This year, the festival will be supported by five Committees: those from Paris, the Val de Seine, the Hurepoix, the Orléanais, and the Vallée de la Marne.

        We thank their respective Presidents Dominique Portal, Christian Padra, Eve Scheltens, Martine Marié and Rémy Divoux.

        On October 25th and 26th, we will offer you a Mixed*(or Ladies) Pairs tournament in two sessions.

        The Open Pairs will be held in three sessions: two sessions of 18 boards on Saturday 27th and a 30 boards’ session on Sunday 28th. Two rankings (scratch for all and a Handicap formula ranking for Series 2 or under ) will allow you to compete with the best ranked.

        New this year: a tournament in Barometer * in two sessions (everyone plays the same boards at the same time; the results are displayed at each round) on Monday 29th and Tuesday 30th October.

        We will close the festival with a tournament in Imps* on Wednesday, October 31st.

        (*) Two Separate tournaments will be offered to you for the mixed, the barometer and the Imps. You will be free to choose a tournament open to all or a tournament reserved for 3rd, 4th series’ and unranked players.

        At the end of each session, we will invite you to an aperitif where you can ask your questions to the champions and at the end of each tournament will be held a cocktail with an awards ceremony.

        Every night, an optional dinner with debate with the champions will give you the opportunity to meet the other participants and discuss with the team members.

        Conferences with Philippe Soulet will be offered to you on Friday, Monday and Wednesday (31) at 10.30am with a debriefing/debate on the best boards played the day before.
