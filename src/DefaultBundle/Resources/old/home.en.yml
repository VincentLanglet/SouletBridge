    text: |
        We are thrilled to welcome you again in the magnificent surroundings of the Paris Country Club to our bridge festival from 25<sup>th</sup> to 31<sup>st</sup> October 2017.

        On 25<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> October we offer you a two days’ Mixed Pairs, followed by a three days’ Open on 27,28 and 29<sup>th</sup> October (with two finals A and B on Sunday 29th).

        We will conclude the festival on 30<sup>th</sup> and 31<sup>st</sup> October with two events taking place simultaneously: one Cup devoted to novice, intermediate and recently advanced players and one IMPs tournament dedicated to advanced and expert players.

        All festival’s tournaments will have even greater prizes than last year in Money or in-kind, with for instance two Cartier’s watches (total value 4700 €) offered by the jewelry Heurgon for the first prize of the Mixed event.

        At the end of each session, we will be pleased to invite you to have drinks with the champions and at the end of each tournament to a cocktail party followed by the prize-giving ceremony.

        Every evening an optional dinner will give you the chance to meet other participants and discuss with the team members.

        On Thursday, Friday and Monday at 10.30am, three free lessons will be offered to you by Philippe Soulet (World champion) with also a debate on the previous day’s best boards.

        You will play in an early 20<sup>th</sup> century listed building surrounded by 136 acres of greenery.

        Only a few meters from the playing room, the newly built 4 stars Hotel Renaissance Paris Hippodrome de St. Cloud is proud to welcome in one of its 110 rooms and suites at a preferred price during the festival (see Hotel).

        Hotel guests will have a free access to the fitness center and will be able to play in the Country Club’s private golf course at an attractive price.
