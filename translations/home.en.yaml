        We are pleased to welcome you again in the beautiful setting of the Paris Country Club Manège for a bridge festival over a week 24 to 31 October 2019.

        New this year, we will close the festival with a unique two-day event (with the same partner): a tournament in Imps on Wednesday October 30th and a pair tournament on Thursday October 31st (with prizes for each tournament and for the tournament). combined).

        All these competitions count for the Val de Seine challenge.

        At the end of each session, we will invite you to an aperitif where you can ask your questions to the champions and at the end of each tournament will be held a cocktail with award ceremony.
